# 2048

An attempt at a basic recreation of the famous game 2048
2048 is a game of skill and chance, which tests your thinking and directional skills. This project is an attempt at making that game, incorporating randomness along with an interface that tries to emulate the game as closely as possible. The buttons are pretty.
